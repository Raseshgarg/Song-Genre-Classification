# Song-Genre-Classification
BANA 8090 (Python Programming) Final Project 

**Task:** To train a model that can classify songs into correct genres. 

**Data:** Dataset of songs, compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. It contains variuos features of songs like acoustincness, tempo etc. for each song along with a label for its genre - either Hip Hop or Rock.
Thus its a binary classification prblem.

**Approach:**

- Pre-processing data
- Exploring features
- Training different classification Models (both single models and ensemble models)
- Tuning model for higher accuracy/AUC score (using RandomizedsearchCV and GridsearchCV)
- Summarizing results
